# Data Science for Business
## Central Asian University — Business School

**Course format:** Practical, notebook-based data science with Python and Jupyter  
**Primary reference:** *Practical Data Science with Jupyter: Explore Data Cleaning, Pre-processing, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering and Machine Learning using Python and Jupyter* — Prateek Gupta, BPB Publications.

> **Course note:** This repository is a course adaptation for business-school students. It is based on the learning sequence and topics of the reference book, but the lectures, business cases, exercises, datasets, and assessments should be developed as original course materials. The book remains the copyrighted property of its author and publisher.

## 1. Course Description

This course introduces students to practical data science through Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, visualization, statistical thinking, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning.

The course follows a **learn → apply → interpret → communicate** workflow. Students begin with Python and data structures, progress to working with real datasets, and finish by developing reproducible business analytics projects in GitHub.

The emphasis is not only on building models. Students will learn to:

- translate a business question into an analytical problem;
- acquire, inspect, clean, and transform data;
- explore data using statistics and visualizations;
- engineer useful features;
- build and evaluate machine-learning models;
- interpret results in a business context;
- communicate findings through Jupyter notebooks;
- organize analytical work using GitHub and reproducible project practices.

The reference book explicitly presents data science as a practical discipline combining mathematics, statistics, computer science, and programming, with a workflow that moves from understanding the business problem through data preparation, visualization, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. 

---

## 2. Course Philosophy

### Business first, model second

A technically sophisticated model is not automatically a useful business solution.

Every major assignment should therefore answer four questions:

1. **What is the business problem?**
2. **What data can help answer it?**
3. **What analytical method is appropriate?**
4. **What decision or action could the analysis support?**

Students should be able to explain their analysis to both a technical audience and a business manager.

### Practical learning

The course uses Jupyter notebooks as the main learning environment. Students are expected to write code, inspect outputs, visualize data, explain findings, and revise their analysis.

The reference book emphasizes a practical approach with relatively little theory and substantial hands-on examples using real-world datasets.

---

## 3. Learning Outcomes

## 7. Notebook Standard

Every submitted notebook should contain the following sections:

```markdown
# Project Title

## 1. Business Question

## 2. Objective

## 3. Data Description

## 4. Data Preparation

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 6. Data Cleaning

## 7. Feature Engineering

## 8. Modeling

## 9. Evaluation

## 10. Business Interpretation

## 11. Limitations

## 12. Conclusion
```

### Minimum coding standard

Students should:

- use meaningful variable names;
- avoid unnecessary repeated code;
- use functions where appropriate;
- comment non-obvious logic;
- keep notebook cells reasonably focused;
- run the notebook from beginning to end before submission;
- make outputs understandable to a reader who did not write the code.

---

## 8. Assessment Framework

A suggested assessment model is:

| Component | Weight |
|---|---:|
| Python & Jupyter labs | 15% |
| Data cleaning and EDA assignments | 15% |
| Statistics assignment | 10% |
| Machine-learning assignments | 20% |
| Time-series assignment | 10% |
| Business case study | 10% |
| Final project | 20% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

> These percentages are a proposed course design and are not taken from the reference book.

### Assessment principle

Students are evaluated on both **technical execution** and **business reasoning**.

A model with high technical performance but weak explanation of the business problem should not automatically receive full credit.

---

## 9. Final Project

### Objective

Students complete an end-to-end data science project addressing a real business or organizational question.

### Possible project themes

- customer segmentation;
- customer churn;
- sales analysis;
- demand forecasting;
- marketing campaign analysis;
- credit-risk modeling;
- pricing analysis;
- employee analytics;
- retail analytics;
- supply-chain analytics;
- recommendation systems;
- fraud/anomaly analysis.

### Required final-project components

- clearly defined business problem;
- dataset and data-source description;
- exploratory data analysis;
- data cleaning;
- preprocessing;
- feature engineering;
- appropriate analytical/modeling method;
- model evaluation where applicable;
- business interpretation;
- limitations and risks;
- reproducible GitHub repository;
- final presentation.

---

## 10. Business Communication

Data science in a business school should not stop at model accuracy.

Students should practice translating:

```text
Data
  ↓
Analysis
  ↓
Evidence
  ↓
Insight
  ↓
Business Implication
  ↓
Decision Support
```

A final presentation should therefore focus on:

- the business question;
- the most important evidence;
- what the model or analysis tells us;
- uncertainty and limitations;
- possible business implications.

Students should avoid presenting statistical or machine-learning output without explaining its practical meaning.

---

## 11. Responsible Data Science

Students should consider:

- data privacy;
- data quality;
- sampling limitations;
- missing information;
- potential bias;
- inappropriate feature use;
- leakage between training and test data;
- misleading visualizations;
- overfitting;
- model limitations;
- uncertainty in predictions.

The objective is to develop analysts who can use data responsibly rather than treating a model's output as automatically correct.

---

## 12. Core Python / Jupyter Toolkit

The course primarily follows the practical Python/Jupyter ecosystem reflected in the reference material.

Suggested tools:

```text
Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
SQLAlchemy
Git
GitHub
```

Additional tools may be introduced when required by a particular project.

For advanced machine-learning work, the reference material also introduces CatBoost.

---

## 13. Environment Setup

A project should use an isolated Python environment.

Example:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment according to the student's operating system, then install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Example `requirements.txt`

```text
jupyter
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
sqlalchemy
```

Add additional packages only when the project requires them.

---

## 14. GitHub Workflow

Students should learn a simple workflow:

```text
Create repository
      ↓
Clone repository
      ↓
Create environment
      ↓
Add data / notebooks / source code
      ↓
Run and test notebook
      ↓
Document work
      ↓
Commit changes
      ↓
Push to GitHub
```

### Suggested commit examples

```text
Add initial EDA notebook
Clean missing values
Add customer segmentation model
Improve feature engineering
Update project README
Add final analysis
```

---

## 15. Suggested Final Repository README

## 20. Course Motto

**Learn → Apply → Interpret → Communicate → Repeat**

The goal is not simply to write Python code or train a machine-learning model. The goal is to use data to investigate meaningful business questions and communicate evidence clearly.
